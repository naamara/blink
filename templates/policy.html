                        <h2>{{APP_NAME}}'s Privacy Policy</h2>
                    </div>
        <p>
Redcore Interactive Limited,`{{DOMAIN_NAME}}`, is serious about protecting your privacy. This Privacy Promise (“Policy”) covers how {{APP_NAME}} collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website and in conjunction with any of the services hosted at {{BASE_URL}} (“Service” and “Website”), including money transfer services accessed by any internet enabled device. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
        <p>The Policy was last updated on August 21, 2012.</p>

      <p>
        <p>This Policy explains what personal information we collect about
            you, with whom we share it, and how you can elect in certain
            situations to not share information with third parties.
            “Personal Information” refers to information such as name
            and email that can be used to identify you individually.</p>

        <p>We may amend this Policy at any time, and whenever we do so we will
            notify you by posting a revised version on the Website. If, however,
            we plan to make a material change in the way we collect, use or store
            your personal information, we will provide prior notice on our
            website, and by email. You will then have the chance to decide
            whether or not we will use or disclose your information in that new
            manner, whether though an “opt-out” procedure or by
            ending your relationship with us.. Such changes will become
            effective, at the earliest, 30 days after the date of the email
            notifications.</p>

        <p>We ask that minors refrain from using our Service or submitting
            any personal information to us. Minors (those under the age of 18
            years) are not eligible to use our Service.</p>
